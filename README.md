# DISW
Spigot Resource: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/disw.106607/


Hello, this plugin was made by me and is a recode from here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/106606
I made this plugin since in the orginal plugin there was unnessary stuff.

You are allowed to decompile it and recompile it if you want.

Installation:
Just drop the DISW.jar in your plugins folder what did you expect

Usage:
If you want to start, run /resetborder.
Take damage to increase the border by 1 block!


Can i change the values?:
No, you can't change values in a config but you can decompile it and recompile it

Rest:
Sorry rkfsociety if you din't had any sussy intentions.
I just wanted to make a plugin in the first place and then
i saw your plugin and saw all the lombok thing stuff.
My mission was to make the plugin more clear and simple.
If you want that i take down this resource u can type that in a rewiew.
